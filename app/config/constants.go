1. Start a Conversation
   - Simply send a message to the bot to begin interaction.

2. Responding to Messages:
   - The bot will use the message's context to provide a relevant response, so use reply function.

3. Setting a Custom Prompt:
   - Use the command /promtset <your_prompt> to set a specific prompt that the bot should consider in its replies.

4. Resetting the Prompt:
   - Use the command /promtreset to remove any previously set prompt and return to default settings.

Happy chatting!
